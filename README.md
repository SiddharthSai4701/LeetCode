This repository has the solutions to LeetCode problems that I've solved.

Generally, this is what you can expect when you open any of the files:

- Initially, I try to solve the problem by myself - hence you may find a number of comments in the file saying "My Solution".
- Then I refer to Greg Hogg's videos to see if I can optimise my solution and/or approach the problem differently. These solution's will typically be preceeded by the comment "Greg's Solution"


I will be updating this repo as I solve more problems!
